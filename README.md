Congratulation! Your team of developers have been chosen to develop a web application to
interface with the Smart Chicken Coop offered by the SwollenHippo company.
The Smart Chicken Coop is a Internet of Things (IoT) connected device with a target market of
busy, lifestyle conscience consumers. These consumers are often young professionals that are
building their career but would like an opportunity to test the waters in the back-to-the-land
movement. Of note, these consumers are likely to shop at retail locations including Tractor
Supply, WholeFoods, and Trader Joe’s.
This application will be a single-page application written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You
are expected to use Bootstrap to help develop a consistent UI across devices (responsive) and
ensure an attractive appearance. In addition to the use of Bootstrap, you will be utilizing the
jQuery library and other components such as SweetAlerts2 and ChartJS.
For this assignment you are expected to begin building your application with three
experiences.
1. The first experience should be a login form. The login form is expected to:
    1. Allow a user to enter their username (email) and password.
    2. Contain an element/mechanism that will allow the user to view a Registration form
    3. Contain an element to ‘login’ to the system.
        1. For this assignment, the login will simply hide the login form and display a new
        blank dashboard experience.
2. The second experience should be a registration form. The registration form is expected to:
    1. Allow a user to enter in the appropriate information to create a new account including
        1. Email
        2. Password
        3. First Name
        4. Last Name
        5. Street Address 1
        6. Street Address 2
        7. City
        8. State
        9. ZIP
        10. Email
        11. Phone
        12. Coop Registration ID
    2. Contain an element/mechanism that will allow the user to cancel the registration
    process and return to the Login experience
    3. Contain an element/mechanism to create an account.
    4. For this assignment, the create account will simple hide the registration form experience
    and display a new blank dashboard experience

3. A blank dashboard experience. The blank dashboard experience is expected to:
    1. Only show a blank screen without any elements or controls

Notes about this assignment:
-You are NOT allowed to use generative AI resources
-You will be assigned a grade based on the following criteria
1. Does the application provide the experiences listed above
2. Your participation within the group. Do you do your part or is your partner doing all the
work?
3. Form validation when clicking on login and registration. Make sure the data is present for
each of those experiences
4. Accessibility standards (review LinkedIn Learning course on accessibility for additional
details)
5. Responsiveness. Remember to design your experiences to work well on large and small
screens. Consider using flex and the grid layout system available in Bootstrap

Extra points will be awarded for things such as:
1. An appropriate branding of the application. Think of the application’s use and its target
market to ensure that it is appropriate.
2. Use of validation techniques not discussed in class such as pattern or regex matching on
email and phone.
3. Other items that are above and beyond the requirements of the application.

Remember this is the first part of your final project. The final projects are graded on a
progressive scoring system with the best project getting the highest grade in the class. Work
now will save A LOT of work and payoff towards the end of the term when time seems to
quicken with other assignments and final preparation.
